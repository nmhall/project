# Nov. 4th Critique

I think my big comment for this week is you guys should keep your code in the repo. That's why you have a repo. Your design and implementation document mentions that you have some work done, but it's hard to help without seeing that work, and most of what you write about we've already discussed.

Do you have any plans to create some basic documentation for the language? Like a cheat sheet that lets you know what conditionals are allowed, etc? That would be helpful as a player (and would help you make sure you have everything in order).

It's not super relevant to your DSL, but for files like your design/implementation document it would be nice if you could explain Spring, I'm not particularly familiar with it. To run your game then I suppose one needs to download:
  * Spring
  * Your DSL compiler
  * A special Spring level file of some sort?
And then they run your DSL compiler on some code, generating an AI file, and then they run Spring with the level and two AI files? It'd be nice to have these steps enumerated somewhere.
