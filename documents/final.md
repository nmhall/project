### Introduction ###
Our DSL allows users to write an AI program for an RTS (Real-Time Strategy) game. Specifically,
it allows you to write instructions for three types of unit in a game of our creation. Each
type of unit has an *IQ* which dictates how many instructions you can write in your program.
Programs are created by filling out a text file with descriptions of the desired behavior for
each type of unit. Users choose from a set of meaningful conditions, and select a behavior
for the unit to follow under that condition, as well as being able to give a default behavior.
By providing a meaningful and interesting set of conditions and behaviors for the user to
choose from, we make it easy for them
