## Introduction: Describe your domain and motivate the need for a DSL (i.e., how could domain-experts use and benefit from a DSL?). What is the essence of your language, and why is it a good language for this domain?

Our DSL allows users to write an AI program for an RTS (Real-Time Strategy) game. Specifically,
it allows you to write instructions for three types of unit in a game of our creation. Each
type of unit has an *IQ* which dictates how many instructions you can write in your program.
Programs are created by filling out a text file with descriptions of the desired behavior for
each type of unit. Users choose from a set of meaningful conditions, and select a behavior
for the unit to follow under that condition, as well as being able to give a default behavior.
By providing a meaningful and interesting set of conditions and behaviors for the user to
choose from, we make it easy for them 

## Language design details: Give a high-level overview of your language's design. Be sure to answer the following questions:

#### How does a user write programs in your language (e.g., do they type in commands, use a visual/graphical tool, speak, etc.)?

#### How does the syntax of your language help users write programs more easily than the syntax of a general-purpose language?


#### What is the basic computation that your language performs (i.e., what is the computational model)?

#### What are the basic data structures in your DSL, if any? How does a the user create and manipulate data?

#### What are the basic control structures in your DSL, if any? How does the user specify or manipulate control flow?

#### What kind(s) of input does a program in your DSL require? What kind(s) of output does a program produce?

#### Error handling: How can programs go wrong, and how does your language communicate those errors to the user?

#### What tool support (e.g., error-checking, development environments) does your project provide?

#### Are there any other DSLs for this domain? If so, what are they, and how does your language compare to these other languages?


#### Example program(s): Provide one or more examples that give the casual reader a good sense of your language. Include inputs and outputs. Think of this section as “Tutorial By Example”. You might combine this section with the previous one, i.e., use examples to help describe your language.

## Language implementation: Describe your implementation. In particular, answer the following questions:

#### What host language did you use (i.e., in what language did you implement your DSL)? Why did you choose this host language (i.e., why is it well-suited for your language design)?

#### Is yours an external or an internal DSL (or some combination thereof)? Why is that the right design?

#### Provide an overview of the architecture of your language: front, middle, and back-end, along with any technologies used to implement these components.

#### “Parsing”: How does your DSL take a user program and turn it into something that can be executed? How do the data and control structures of your DSL connect to the underlying semantic model?

#### Intermediate representation: What data structure(s) in the host language do you use to represent a program in your DSL?

#### Execution: How did you implement the computational model? Describe the structure of your code and any special programming techniques you used to implement your language. In particular, how do the semantics of your host language differ from the semantics of your DSL?

## Evaluation: Provide some analysis of the work you did. In particular:

#### How “DSL-y” is your language? How close or far away is it from a general- purpose language?

#### What works well in your language? What are you particularly pleased with?

#### What could be improved? For example, how could the user's experience be better? How might your implementation be simpler or more cohesive? Are there more features you'd like to have? Does your current implementation differ from your larger vision for the language?


#### Re-visit your evaluation plan from the beginning of the project. Which tools have you used to evaluate the quality of your design? What have you learned from these evaluations? Have you made any significant changes as a result of these tools, the critiques, or user tests?

#### Where did you run into trouble and why? For example, did you come up with some syntax that you found difficult to implement, given your host language choice? Did you want to support multiple features, but you had trouble getting them to play well together?
