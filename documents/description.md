# Project description and plan

## Motivation

This project is interesting because it's a novel way to add
a mechanic to a game, which should be fun to play! The
problem we're interested in solving here is how to "play" a
real time strategy game. We think that one interesting
approach would be to encode behaviors for units and then let
battles play out from there. Given this approach to the game,
a domain specific language seems like an appropriate solution. In general we want to encode behaviors using a
programming language, but obviously the existing languages aren't particularly well suited for this purpose.
