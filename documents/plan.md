# Project plan

## Language evaluation
Our language will have accomplished its goals if we can use it to write
functional AIs for our game. Our goals for the language design are:
  + We can write multiple non-trivial AIs with fundamentally different strategies.
  + IQ is the limiting resource (i.e. a unit with 10 IQ should be easy to make
    considerably stronger than a unit with 5 IQ).
  + Classes of units serve different purposes and are all valuable
  + Any trivial implementation loses to a well-designed non-trivial one (this is
    a bit vague on the definition of well-designed, but the idea is that the
    game needs to reward cleverness).
  + Being efficient with commands for low-IQ units and being clever with commands
    for high-IQ units should both significantly improve the AI.
For implementation, we will have unit tests ensuring syntax correctness for the
language, as well as manually verifying that units behave as instructed.
