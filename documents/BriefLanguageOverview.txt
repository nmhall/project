Short: 3 IQ
Int: 6 IQ

You can use as many rules for a given unit as you have IQ. If you leave a
category completely empty, it will default to pretty bad behavior.

A rule looks like either
default: command
OR
Conditional: command

The first rule in each category must be default, and the rest must be
conditionals

Conditionals other than default look like "if" <conditions>:
You can string as many conditions as you want together using and (but not or)

Formation commands: tight formation, loose formation, isolation
Movement commands: move toward, move away, hold ground
Targeting commands: target closest, target farthest, target lowest health,
                    target smartest, target highest range

Conditions:
  there are X enemies adjacent/close/around
  there are X allies adjacent/close/around
  health >/< X
  a nearby enemy has IQ >/< X
  a nearby enemy has health >/< X
  a nearby enemy has range >/< X
